// handleSigPipe catches SIGPIPE and exits abnormally with status code 2.

// Background:
//
// systemd interprets programs exited with SIGPIPE as
// "successfully exited" because its default SuccessExitStatus=
// includes SIGPIPE.
// https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html
//
// Normal Go programs ignore SIGPIPE for file descriptors other than
// stdout(1) and stderr(2).  If SIGPIPE is raised from stdout or stderr,
// Go programs exit with a SIGPIPE signal.
// https://golang.org/pkg/os/signal/#hdr-SIGPIPE
//
// journald is a service tightly integrated in systemd.  Go programs
// running as a systemd service will normally connect their stdout and
// stderr pipes to journald.  Unfortunately though, journald often
// dies and restarts due to bugs, and once it restarts, programs
// whose stdout and stderr were connected to journald will receive
// SIGPIPE at their next writes to stdout or stderr.
//
// Combined these specifications and problems all together, Go programs
// running as systemd services often die with SIGPIPE, but systemd will
// not restart them as they "successfully exited" except when the service
// is configured with SuccessExitStatus= without SIGPIPE or Restart=always.
//
// Ignoring SIGPIPE would not help; the stdout or stderr pipes will
// be choked and eventually the Go program will stop forever there
// if a service ignores SIGPIPE and writes to them contiuously.
//
// Handling SIGPIPE manually and exiting with abnormal status code 2
// can work around the problem.
